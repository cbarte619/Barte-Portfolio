    "In conclusion, the variables that help with attendance and the variables that harm attendance were listed. To build next year's schedule, I highly suggest using both pieces of information in tandem. For example, the variable which yielded the highest attendance was the bobblehead variable, but the least attended games were on Mondays or Wednesdays. If a bobble head was given away on Mondays or Wednesdays, attendance would most likely increase. The most popular opponents are Mets, Nationals, or White Sox, but September and October were least popular months. If these games were scheduled during less popular months, attendance would most likely go up. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the long-term change of the schedule, some precautions could be taken to aid attendance at the last minute. For example, cloudy days were proven to yield a weaker attendance. To aid this, ticket prices could decrease on the day of the game. Or a stock of free T-shirts could be kept at the arena and they could be given out to games with the least popular opponents or in the less popular months. "
