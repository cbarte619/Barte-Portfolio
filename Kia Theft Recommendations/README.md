# Kia Theft Analysis  

## Introduction  
As a local analyst, I have been tasked by the Milwaukee Police Department to investigate the alarming increase in Kia thefts. Upon further research, I discovered that this issue extends beyond Milwaukee and is occurring nationwide. With the department's assistance, I obtained four datasets containing information on theft locations, the percentage of other vehicles stolen, and the year of the thefts. My objective is to identify trends that can help law enforcement agencies allocate patrols and resources more effectively.  

## Audience  
The primary audience for this analysis is the **Milwaukee Police Board of Advisors**. While they are familiar with the Milwaukee dataset, they are not acquainted with the other three datasets. Therefore, I can use technical language in my presentation, but if the board wishes to share the findings with police officers or other stakeholders, I am prepared to adjust the wording accordingly for broader accessibility.  

## Purpose  
The purpose of this analysis is to **identify patterns in Kia vehicle thefts** and assist law enforcement in implementing preventive measures. Based on my findings, I will recommend proactive strategies, such as:  
- Collaborating with cities that have lower theft rates to learn about their preventive measures.  
- Allocating patrols more effectively based on theft hotspots.  
- Implementing community awareness programs to reduce vehicle theft risks.  

## Medium  
I will present my findings to the board of advisors using a **PowerPoint presentation**. To highlight key insights, I have created **six visualizations** that showcase theft trends across different cities. A PowerPoint presentation is an optimal choice as it is easily shareable and more user-friendly than a dashboard, making it accessible for frontline officers and other departments.  

## Design Choices  
To ensure clarity and effectiveness, my presentation follows a **concise and structured approach**:  
- **Minimal slides** to keep the focus on key findings.  
- **An introduction, visualizations, and a conclusion with actionable recommendations**.  
- **Use of color in visualizations** to emphasize significant trends and insights.  

## Ethical Considerations  
- **Data Integrity**: No entries were removed; only character values were converted into numerical data for visualization purposes.  
- **Data Privacy**: Since the dataset includes demographic information, adhering to privacy laws is a top priority.  
- **Avoiding Overgeneralization**: To prevent misleading conclusions, other cities should provide contextual input before Milwaukee adopts any external strategies.  
- **Data Reliability**: The data was obtained directly from government sources with permission from the police department, ensuring credibility. No third-party sources were used.  

### **Mitigating Ethical Risks**  
To maintain **transparency and accuracy**, I will:  
- Clearly present all data transformations.  
- Engage with community stakeholders for additional insights.  
- Ensure that recommendations are based on comprehensive and well-contextualized findings.
