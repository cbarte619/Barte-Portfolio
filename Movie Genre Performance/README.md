# Movie Genre Analysis
## Business Problem
My project is exploring the tie between movie genres and their performance, in terms of revenue generation and popularity. I also want to identify trends which have emerged in the film industry over the years. The central business problem is as follows: How can movie studios, producers, and distributors optimize their investment strategies by understanding trends in movie genres and revenue generation between 1995 and 2018?
## Background/History
	Understanding the background of the movie industry during this time is crucial for creating the analysis. This era witnessed significant changes in things such as technology, audience trends, and distribution method. All these factors influenced movie genre performance and total revenue created. 
	The first thing to consider is genre popularity. For example, action, sci-fi, and fantasy genres have become increasingly popular due to special effects and CGI advances. This can also be due to the rise of franchises such as Star Wars or Harry Potter. Genres such as romance have seen decline in theatrical success but have gained traction due to the rise of streaming platforms. 
	The next consideration is the rise of technological advancements. The use of CGI became mainstream in the mid-1990s with success of movies such as Jurassic Park. The use of digital cameras also reduces production costs. The creation of 3D movies also temporarily boosted revenue in the 2010s.
	The last consideration is change in audience behavior. Oftentimes, moviegoers favor high budget or event driven films, which are often released during the holiday season. The creation of franchises also became a dominant strategy to assure recurring box office success. In addition, streaming services such as Netflix and the creation of DVD's caused a decline of movies in theaters. 
## Data Explanation
The dataset I am using for my project is titled “Movie genre statistics and revenue data from 1995-2018”. I received this dataset from Kaggle. The data set contains statistics from 1995-2018 and includes characteristics such as genre, revenue, year released, and others. This data is in a csv file. A table of each variable along with a brief description of each variable is shown in the appendix. 
To begin my analysis, I did a very simple preview of my data set. The first thing I checked for was missing values, however my data set was not missing any values, so I did not need to handle them. The next thing I did was remove the “index” column, as I did not think this was beneficial to my analysis. 
## Methods
	To complete this project, I am using Jupyter Notebook to identify trends. This is done by analyzing revenue distribution and comparing it to movie genres. Another helpful tool with this is correlation analysis. 
## Analysis
	To begin, I created a code which lists the movie genres sorted by the most revenue created. This shows that the top 3 highest grossing genres are Adventure, Action, and Drama films. Then, I created a correlation matrix to show which variables have the highest correlation. I then printed the matrix for an easy analysis. To easily show my correlations in visualization format, I used Jupyter Notebook to create a heatmap using the created matrix. The result is shown in the appendix below. 
	I then created four different visualizations. The first one shows distribution of movies released by genre. With this, I thought the movies which create the most revenue would have the most movies released (Adventure, Action, Drama). This was not the case. Drama and Documentary movies had the most releases. The next visualization shows the gross revenue per year of each movie genre. In recent years, action and adventure movies have grossed the highest. The third visualization shows gross revenue and tickets sold. For action and adventure movies, the more tickets sold, the higher the revenue. Since these movies usually have larger budgets, this makes sense. The last visualization shows top movie gross by year. In 2018, Adventure movies had the highest gross of all time, most likely due to box office blockbusters. All of these visualizations can be seen in the appendix. 
## Conclusion
	In summary, the most common trends with my analysis were with Action and Adventure movies. Especially in recent years, these movies have been very successful, yielding the highest revenue. From a filmmaker perspective, it is recommended to make movies in these genres. However, with these movies, revenue is tied closely to ticket sales. My recommendation would be to use more of the budget on the trailer or the marketing, which will draw audiences to purchase tickets. 
## Assumptions
	My dataset was straightforward and did not require any assumptions to be made. In this analysis, the only assumption which I would make is in the case of missing values. For example, if the genre was missing, I would fill in values the best I could. 
## Limitations/Challenges
In the past, the biggest issue I have had with analysis was data quality. For example, some movies may lack input such as ratings, genre information, or runtimes. However, I once again checked the dataset before I chose it, and my dataset lacks incomplete data entries. 
## Future Uses/Additional Applications
	This model can be used in various other domains beyond the original plan. One example is for streaming platforms. With the rise of platforms such as Netflix, this model could be used to personalize movie recommendations. This could be done using trends in genre preferences, revenue success, or user ratings.
## Recommendations
	It is recommended to prioritize investments in genres with consistent revenue, such as action. This can also be done using sequels and spin-offs. Also, it is recommended that to diversify content, hybrid genres are used. For example, an emerging genre currently is sci-fi-thriller. This can capture a niche audience while still creating revenue. 
## Implementation Plan
	As previously mentioned, most genres yield higher revenue when more tickets are sold. Since revenue is the focus of this plan, it is important to contact the marketing team near the beginning of every project. This should be done specifically when creating movies with a high-ticket-sales genre, such as action. By setting goals for a marketing budget ahead of movie creation, this can ensure more tickets will be sold and an overall higher revenue is generated. 
## Ethical Assessment
There are minimal ethical considerations with this dataset. The biggest one I looked for was personal data issues, yet I ensured the data was anonymized before I chose the dataset. There are no individual contributions in this dataset without consent.
