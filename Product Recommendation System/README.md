# Personalized Product Recommender System for Retail  

## Business Problem  
The goal of this project is to develop a **personalized product recommender system** for retail customers. By leveraging customer preferences, the system aims to increase engagement, satisfaction, and sales, while optimizing inventory turnover and giving the store a competitive edge.  

## Background/History  
Recommender systems became essential for personalized technology, with early models like GroupLens in the 1990s. Over time, methods like **collaborative filtering** and **content-based filtering** have evolved. Today, hybrid models, incorporating **AI and graph-based algorithms**, provide highly personalized real-time suggestions for users.  

## Dataset  
- **Source**: Kaggle  
- **Entries**: 4,500+  
- **Attributes**: Brand, Color, Size, Price, Discount, etc.  
- **Format**: CSV  

## Methods  
This project uses a **content-based filtering** approach, where product recommendations are based on item attributes (e.g., brand, price, size). Using **Jupyter Notebook**, a **TF-IDF** matrix is created to compute similarity scores and recommend products based on the closest matches to customer preferences.

## Data Cleaning & Analysis  
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed irrelevant columns (currency, MRP) and checked for missing values (none found).  
2. **Discount Calculation**: Used the discount column to calculate actual prices.  
3. **Visualizations**:  
   - Price distribution: Most products fall between $0–5000, with an average of $500.  
   - Top product categories: Westernwear leads with over 1600 items.  
   - Price by category: Women’s watches are the most expensive, averaging $7000.  
   - Discount distribution: Most products are discounted by 10%, with few items discounted more than 50%.  

## Recommender System  
1. **TF-IDF Matrix**: Constructed a matrix based on product attributes.  
2. **Similarity Scores**: Calculated the similarity between products and recommended the best matches based on product ID.

## Conclusion  
The recommender system enhances customer experience, increases sales, and fosters loyalty by providing personalized product suggestions. This model can significantly improve retail business strategies and offer customers a more tailored shopping experience.

## Assumptions  
- Missing values (e.g., price) would be filled to maintain model accuracy.
- No significant assumptions were made during data cleaning or processing.

## Limitations/Challenges  
- The dynamic nature of sales data makes it difficult to keep the model up-to-date unless the dataset is refreshed regularly.
- The dataset lacks real-time user interactions or ratings, which could enhance the model.

## Future Uses/Additional Applications  
- **Product Bundling**: Suggest complementary products.  
- **Price Recommendations**: Offer personalized pricing.  
- **AI Integration**: Use AI for creating virtual assistants or integrating with mobile apps for real-time suggestions.

## Recommendations  
1. **Focus on Westernwear**: As the most stocked category, targeted advertising and bundling could drive sales.
2. **Premium Services for High-Value Items**: Women’s watches and other high-ticket items can be marketed with exclusive discounts.
3. **Tiered Discount Strategy**: Introduce larger discounts for slow-moving or high-margin products.

## Implementation Plan  
- **User Interface**: Create a customer-friendly interface for online stores or integrate with mobile apps for product recommendations.  
- **Customer Feedback**: Use feedback to refine the model and improve recommendations.
  
## Ethical Assessment  
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.  
- **Bias Avoidance**: Avoid recommending only popular or high-margin items to ensure fairness across all product categories.  
- **Transparency**: Provide clear explanations for recommendations and allow customers to opt-out of data usage.
