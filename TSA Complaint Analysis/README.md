# Airport Passenger Feedback Analysis  

## Audience  
As an Airport Operations Analyst for a major international airport, my role is to analyze passenger feedback to improve overall airport operations. Due to a recent increase in passenger complaints, management has tasked me with identifying key issues and trends. My findings will be presented to Operations Managers and Customer Service Managers, who will then communicate these insights to their respective teams.  

## Purpose  
The objective of this analysis is to help the international airport develop strategies to enhance the passenger experience. Potential improvements could include:  
- Reevaluating the TSA screening process  
- Addressing recurring issues during specific times of the year  
- Implementing additional staff training  

By acting on these insights, the airport aims to improve overall passenger satisfaction and increase positive reviews.  

## Medium & Design  
To effectively present my findings, I will create a **PowerPoint presentation**, as it is easily shareable and accessible across various devices. This will allow Operations and Customer Service Managers to efficiently communicate recommendations to their teams.  

### **Design Approach**  
- A **clean, minimalistic layout** with a light background and dark text for readability.  
- Focus primarily on **recommendations** rather than extensive background information.  
- An **actionable “Next Steps” slide** at the end to outline how the airport can implement suggested improvements.  

## Ethical Considerations  
- The data used for this analysis was **directly provided by the airport**, ensuring credibility and ethical sourcing.  
- There are **minimal legal or regulatory concerns** related to this dataset.  
- No data values were altered or removed—only grouped for analysis—ensuring an accurate and unbiased representation of passenger feedback.
