# White House Visitor Data Analysis  

## Introduction  
As the scheduler for White House appointments, my goal is to analyze visitor data to uncover trends and optimize scheduling. By examining the White House Visitor Data, I aim to determine the most and least popular days for appointments. If certain days or months experience lower visitor traffic, it may be beneficial to adjust operational hours—reducing unnecessary staffing costs, minimizing foot traffic, and allowing visitees to allocate their time more effectively. This data-driven approach ensures that resources are used efficiently while maintaining accessibility for visitors.  

## Audience  
The primary audience for this analysis includes:  
- **White House executive board** – Decision-makers responsible for approving operational changes.  
- **Scheduling team** – Those responsible for setting and managing White House hours.  
- **Visitees** – Individuals who may provide insights to refine the proposed schedule for better alignment with their needs.  

## Medium  
To support my findings, I have developed:  
- **Five visualizations** that provide an initial analysis of visitor trends.  
- **A PowerPoint presentation** to effectively communicate recommendations, making it easier to present and justify adjustments to the White House schedule.
