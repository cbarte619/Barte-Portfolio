## Introduction
As the scheduler for White House appointments, my goal is to analyze visitor data to uncover trends and optimize scheduling. By examining the White House Visitor Data, I aim to determine the most and least popular days for appointments. If certain days or months experience lower visitor traffic, it may be beneficial to adjust operational hoursâ€”reducing unnecessary staffing costs, minimizing foot traffic, and allowing visitees to allocate their time more effectively. This data-driven approach ensures that resources are used efficiently while maintaining accessibility for visitors.

## Audience
The primary audience for this analysis includes the White House executive board and the scheduling team responsible for setting operational hours. Additionally, visitees may provide insights to refine the proposed schedule, ensuring it aligns with their availability and priorities.

## Medium
To support my findings, I have developed five visualizations that provide an initial analysis of visitor trends. Additionally, I have compiled a PowerPoint presentation to effectively communicate my recommendations, making it easier to present and justify adjustments to the White House schedule.
