    "In this scenario, I am the scheduler of these appointments. Given the White House Visitor Data, I want to identify trends in the appointments. I want to determine if there are certain days The White House should be open for appointment, and which days The White House should be closed. If certain days/months are less populated with visitors, there is less of a need to keep it open 24/7. This would save The White House money and time with staffing, would reduce unnecessary foot traffic, and would give the visitees more time for other necessary activities."
