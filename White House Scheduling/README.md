# White House Visitor Data Analysis  

## Introduction  
As the scheduler for White House appointments, my objective is to analyze visitor data to identify trends and optimize scheduling. By examining the White House Visitor Data, I aim to determine:  
- Which days the White House should be open for appointments.  
- Whether certain days should be closed to visitors.  
- If specific months warrant limited operational hours due to lower visitor traffic.  

By adjusting scheduling based on visitor trends, this approach can:  
- Reduce staffing costs and unnecessary foot traffic.  
- Improve time management for visited officials.  
- Optimize operational efficiency while maintaining accessibility.  

## Audience  
This analysis is intended for:  
- **The White House Executive Board** – Decision-makers responsible for operational policies.  
- **The Official Scheduler** – Responsible for managing White House appointment hours.  
- **Visited Officials** – Individuals impacted by scheduling changes who can provide critical insights for refining recommendations.  

Since my findings may influence appointment scheduling, it is essential that visited officials are involved in discussions to ensure practical and informed decisions.  

## Medium  
To effectively communicate my findings, I will create a **PowerPoint presentation** tailored to my audience.  
- **For the executive board and official scheduler**, I will use technical jargon as needed.  
- **For visited officials**, I will summarize key points, focusing on how changes impact their schedules without unnecessary technical details.  

## Design Choices  
To ensure a clear and professional presentation:  
- **A plain, lightly colored background** is used for readability and simplicity.  
- **Graphs include summaries at the bottom** to highlight key insights.  
- **No animations** are added to maintain a professional and straightforward style.  
- **A consistent color scheme (e.g., blue)** is used to highlight key data points in visualizations.  

## Ethical Considerations  
- **Data Integrity**: No modifications were made to the original data beyond removing irrelevant columns.  
- **Data Transformation**: New columns were created (e.g., month, days between appointment scheduling and the actual appointment), but these did not alter the dataset’s integrity.  
- **Data Credibility**: All data was legally released by the White House in CSV format, ensuring ethical sourcing and transparency.  
- **Minimal Risks**: Since no major transformations or assumptions were made, the analysis remains unbiased and accurate.
