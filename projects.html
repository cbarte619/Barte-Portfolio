        <h2>üé¨ Movie Recommender System</h2>
        <p>This project is a movie recommender system that suggests films based on user preferences using cosine similarity. The system computes cosine similarity scores to identify and rank the most relevant movie recommendations. Built with Python, it leverages Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for vectorization and similarity calculations, and NumPy for mathematical operations, providing an efficient and data-driven recommendation approach.</p>

        <h2>üõí Walmart Sales Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>This project analyzes Walmart's sales data to identify the key factors influencing revenue, aiming to improve forecasting and strategic decision-making.. Initial analysis revealed that lower temperatures, higher fuel prices, inflation, and higher unemployment negatively impacted sales. Through data cleaning, feature engineering, and the development of linear regression and decision tree models, the project improved prediction accuracy, though further refinements are needed. Future work will incorporate additional factors like store location, promotions, and competitor pricing to enhance predictive power and precision.</p>

        <h2>üèõÔ∏è White House Scheduling</h2>
        <p>This analysis of White House visitor data is in the perspective of the White House appointment scheduler. It aims to optimize scheduling by identifying trends to determine the most efficient days for appointments, potential days for closure, and the need for limited operational hours during low-traffic months. The analysis will help reduce staffing costs, minimize foot traffic, and improve time management for visited officials. </p>

        <h2>‚öæ Dodgers Game Scheduling</h2>
        <p>This project examines attendance trends at Los Angeles Dodgers games to identify factors affecting crowd size and provide scheduling recommendations. To improve attendance, schedulers should leverage promotions like item giveaways on low-traffic days, prioritize high-profile opponents in slower months, and implement last-minute incentives like weather-based discounts. By integrating these insights, the Dodgers can optimize game schedules for maximum attendance..</p>

        <h2>üèí NHL MVP Predictor Model</h2>
        <p>This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast NHL players' likelihood of winning the Hart Trophy using player statistics from 2004-2018. The model leverages logistic regression to identify correlations between performance metrics and award outcomes. Despite refinements through correlation analysis and feature selection, results suggest that a more complex model incorporating non-numerical factors may be needed for improved predictions.</p>
