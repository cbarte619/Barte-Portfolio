        <h2>🎬 Movie Recommender System</h2>
        <p>This project is a movie recommender system that suggests films based on user preferences using cosine similarity. The system computes cosine similarity scores to identify and rank the most relevant movie recommendations. Built with Python, it leverages Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for vectorization and similarity calculations, and NumPy for mathematical operations, providing an efficient and data-driven recommendation approach.</p>

        <h2>🛒 Walmart Sales Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>This project analyzes Walmart's sales data to identify the key factors influencing revenue, aiming to improve forecasting and strategic decision-making.. Initial analysis revealed that lower temperatures, higher fuel prices, inflation, and higher unemployment negatively impacted sales. Through data cleaning, feature engineering, and the development of linear regression and decision tree models, the project improved prediction accuracy, though further refinements are needed. Future work will incorporate additional factors like store location, promotions, and competitor pricing to enhance predictive power and precision.</p>
